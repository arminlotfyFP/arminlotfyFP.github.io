            <a><strong>Energy Management of Battery Electric Vehicles Using MATD3 Algorithms</strong></a>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                This project focused on developing and implementing a Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient 
		    (MATD3)-based Energy Management System (EMS) for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). The primary objective was to 
		    enhance the driving range of BEVs by integrating an advanced MATD3-EMS with battery cell balancing techniques. 
		    The project utilized the MATLAB environment to design, simulate, and optimize the proposed system, aiming to achieve efficient 
		    energy utilization and extended battery longevity.</p>

            <a><strong>Centralized Multi-Agent SOC Control for Battery Health Using Proximal Policy Optimization in EVs</strong></a>
	    <p style="text-align: justify;">
		    This project proposes a model-free cooperative multi-agent control framework designed to
		    regulate and balance the SOC of lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells in EVs during real-time driving operations. The proposed 
		    method utilizes a series architecture comprising three LIB cells, each equipped with a buck-boost converter and a proportional-integral 
		    (PI) controller, controlled by a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is 
		    used as the RL agent in this multi-agent framework, where each PPO agent independently manages the SOC of a corresponding battery
		    cell based on observed data. During the training phase, all PPO agents work collaboratively to balance the SOCs of the LIB cells,
		    thereby preventing interruptions in EV performance. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing its 
		    performance with single-agent methods such as PPO, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3),
		    as well as with other multi-agent methods. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the existing approaches, indicating
		    its potential for superior performance.</p>

	    <p style="text-align: justify;">
		    In this project, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based power-sharing controller was designed and implemented in MATLAB. 
		    The controller is robust to unforeseen fault scenarios and demonstrates adaptability in dynamically adjusting power distribution 
		    under varying conditions. By leveraging the PPO algorithm, the controller effectively handles uncertainties and ensures reliable 
		    power-sharing performance across different operational scenarios, contributing to improved system resilience and efficiency.</p>

		This project focuses on developing and implementing a battery controller in Python using libraries such as

		    and Deep Learning (DL)-based Energy Management System (EMS) capable of adapting to various observation signals and predicting 
		    optimal control signals in real time. The system under test is a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) equipped with a hybrid energy 
		    storage system comprising a battery and a supercapacitor, aimed at achieving efficient energy utilization and enhanced performance.</p>
